# Shop Tabs
Shop Tabs is a mod for Stardew Valley 1.6.8+ that adds a series of tabs to filter items sold in each shop.

# Installation
Extract into Mods folder of Stardew Valley.

# Requirements
Stardew Valley 1.6.8+
SMAPI v4.0.7+
For SDV 1.6.8 use version 1.0.1
For SDV 1.6.9+ use the latest version

# Known issues:
- All non-Object type items in the base game (weapon, tools, etc) will be filtered into "Other"
- Swapping out of a tab after purchasing a limited-amount item, and immediately swapping back will restock it. (solved by re-opening the shop)
- Using Lookup Anything on a shop item will cause all other filters to disappear. (solved by re-opening the shop)

# Compatibilities:
- All vinilla shops
- Any mod that add custom shops using the built in ShopMenu class, e.g:
- Stardew Valley Expanded﻿
- Ridgeside Village﻿
- East Scarp﻿
- Visit Mount Vapius
- Passerby Cemetry﻿﻿
- Any mods that alter the shop stock should also work
If you find anything that is incompatible, leave a comment and I'll be on it
